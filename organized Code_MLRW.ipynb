I did a lot of experimentations, but its not possible to document everything so in this writeup I will try to explain the approach that gave me the best score.\n","\n","1. The most crucial task was the appropriate feature/column selection out of those 54 columns. And then curating more data from the unlabelled data.\n","   After a lot of hit and trial I was able to choose [\"characteristics_ch1\",\"molecule_ch1\",\"organism_ch1\",'type',\"title\"] this columns which was relevant for our classification task. \n","\n","2. I tried going for simple approach that Is using only small labelled dataset for training and making submission. \n","   As the data was very less it was not well generalized for testing data. That lead to the need of generating more data.\n","\n","3.Next step was to generate more data. Larger datasets helped model to become more robust. So we had around 20k unlabelled datapoints. \n","  I trained a voting ensemble classifier with 7 models- Na√Øve bayes, RF, DT, Adaboost, gradient boosting, xgb, mlp.   And used soft voting method (weight average of probabilities) to predict the labels for 15,000 samples.\n","\n","4. So Now data size has been increased to 15,000 samples. I trained the classification model on this extended data and at the end logistic regression gave me the best accuracy.\n","\n","\n","\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":168,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.758604Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.757632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.775614Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.774898Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.758547Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/mlrw-biomedicalhackathon/sample_submission.csv\n","/kaggle/input/mlrw-biomedicalhackathon/data_only_test.csv\n","/kaggle/input/mlrw-biomedicalhackathon/unlabelled_train_data.csv\n","/kaggle/input/mlrw-biomedicalhackathon/labelled_train_data.csv\n"]}],"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n","\n","import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n","# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Importing required libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":169,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.778065Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.777176Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.788691Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.787776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-02T08:39:27.778017Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n"]}],"source":["# Used in all sections for managing data and files\n","import os\n","import numpy as np\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import pandas as pd\n","import pickle\n","import re\n","\n","# NTLK is used for preprocessing text.
